This is achieved through a process of pre-training on massive amounts of unlabeled text data from sources like Wikipedia and books corpus. By analyzing this data, BERT is able to learn the patterns and relationships between words, allowing it to generate contextualized representations of words.</p> <p>For example, consider the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat.\" Without any context, the word \"cat\" could refer to any type of feline, but with the context of the sentence, we know that it is referring to a specific cat that is sitting on a mat. BERT is able to capture this context and relationship between the words in the sentence, allowing it to generate a more accurate representation of the sentence as a whole.</p> <p>In contrast, traditional word-based models such as word2vec or GloVe, which only consider the individual word meanings, would generate embeddings for \"cat\" and \"mat\" that do not capture the relationship between them in the context of the sentence. This can lead to less accurate predictions and poorer performance on tasks such as language translation or sentiment analysis. BERT's ability to capture context and relationships between words is a key factor in its success and has led to significant improvements across a wide range of NLP tasks.</p>"},{"location":"bert/#self-attention","title":"Self-attention","text":"<p>Self-attention is a mechanism in deep learning that allows a model to attend to different parts of an input sequence when making predictions. It is a way for the model to weigh the importance of different features in the input and use that information to make more accurate predictions.</p> <p>Intuitively, self-attention can be thought of as a way for the model to \"focus\" on certain parts of the input when making predictions. For example, if the input is a sequence of words, self-attention can allow the model to focus on certain words that are more important for making a prediction, rather than considering the entire sequence equally.</p> <p>Self-attention is implemented using a set of learnable weights that are used to compute a set of attention scores. These attention scores represent the degree to which each feature in the input is important for making a prediction. The attention scores are then used to weight the input features, so that more important features are given more weight and less important features are given less weight. This is especially useful for tasks like machine translation, where the model needs to understand the context of an entire sentence rather than individual words. Self-attention has also been used in computer vision tasks, where it can help the model to focus on certain parts of an image that are more important for making a prediction.</p> <p>Mathematically, Self-Attention can be represented as:</p> <p> </p> <p>where Q, K, V are learnable matrices for projections of queries (Q), keys (K) and values (V). </p> <p>The attention score between a query and each key in the sequence is calculated using a dot product, and then normalized through the softmax function to get the weight for each value vector.</p> <p>Let's break it down step-by-step: </p> <ol> <li>Calculate Query Matrix:</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>where x is the input sequence and W_q is a weight matrix for queries.</p> <ol> <li>Calculate Key Matrix:</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>where W_k is a weight matrix for keys.</p> <ol> <li>Calculate Value Matrix:</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>where W_v is a weight matrix for values.</p> <p>We have now taken input x and compute 3 distinct linear transformations.</p> <ol> <li>Dot Product Attention:</li> </ol> <p>Attention scores are calculated as the dot product between Q and K, followed by a softmax function to obtain the weights for each value vector:</p> <p> </p> <p>where d_k is the dimensionality of key vectors.</p> <ol> <li>Weighted Sum of Value Matrix:</li> </ol> <p>Finally, the output of the self-attention mechanism is obtained by taking a weighted sum of value vectors using attention scores from step 4:</p> <p> </p> <p>Self-Attention is a powerful technique that allows models to capture context and relationships between parts of an input sequence.

We then initialize the GPT-2 tokenizer using the <code>from_pretrained</code> method and pass it the name of the pre-trained model (\"gpt2\" in this case). Next, we use the <code>encode</code> method of the tokenizer to convert the text into a list of input-ids. We also set the <code>add_special_tokens</code> parameter to <code>True</code> to ensure that the input-ids include the special tokens that are used by the GPT-2 model (e.g. <code>[CLS]</code> and <code>[SEP]</code>). Finally, we create a tensor of the input-ids and a tensor of the targets. The targets are simply a copy of the input-ids, which is what we will use to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on our specific task.</p> <p>No, the targets and input-ids are not identical for training a GPT-2 model. The input-ids are the tokenized representations of the input text, which are fed into the model during training. These input-ids are typically obtained using a tokenizer, such as the GPT-2 tokenizer, which converts the input text into a sequence of integers. The targets, on the other hand, are the expected output tokens that the model should predict given the input-ids. For example, if the input text is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", the target might be \"jumps over the lazy dog\". The targets are used to calculate the loss during training, which is a measure of how well the model is predicting the correct output tokens. In summary, the input-ids are the tokenized representations of the input text, while the targets are the expected output tokens that the model should predict given the input-ids.</p> <p>Yes, it is possible to train a GPT model to predict multiple tokens at a time. This can be achieved by adjusting the architecture of the model and the training process. One way to do this is to modify the model's output layer to predict a sequence of tokens instead of a single token. This can be done by using a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer architecture with a decoder layer. The output layer would then generate a sequence of tokens one at a time, with each token being predicted based on the previous tokens in the sequence. During training, the model would be presented with a sequence of tokens as input and would be asked to predict the next token in the sequence. The loss function would be calculated based on the difference between the predicted sequence and the actual sequence of tokens. It's worth noting that training a model to predict multiple tokens at a time can be more challenging than training a model to predict a single token, as it requires the model to maintain a context and generate coherent sequences of tokens. However, with the right architecture and training process, it is definitely possible to achieve this.</p>"}]}
