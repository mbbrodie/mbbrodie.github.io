This can be achieved by adjusting the architecture of the model and the training process. One way to do this is to modify the model's output layer to predict a sequence of tokens instead of a single token. This can be done by using a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer architecture with a decoder layer. The output layer would then generate a sequence of tokens one at a time, with each token being predicted based on the previous tokens in the sequence. During training, the model would be presented with a sequence of tokens as input and would be asked to predict the next token in the sequence. The loss function would be calculated based on the difference between the predicted sequence and the actual sequence of tokens. It's worth noting that training a model to predict multiple tokens at a time can be more challenging than training a model to predict a single token, as it requires the model to maintain a context and generate coherent sequences of tokens.

One of the critical aspects driving these advances is the development of generative models, which are able to learn complex probability distributions from data and generate new samples that resemble the training data. Two of the most well-known generative model families are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In this blog post, we will discuss recent advances in these two models and explore other promising directions for research in generative modeling.</p> <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</p> <p>GANs are a powerful class of machine learning models that involve two networks \u2013 the generator and the discriminator \u2013 which compete against each other in a minimax game to produce realistic-looking samples from a given dataset. The generator tries to create fake examples that can fool the discriminator, while the discriminator attempts to identify whether an example is real or synthetic. Over time, both networks improve through backpropagation, resulting in better-quality generated data.</p> <p>Recent advances in GANs include:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Improved stability and training: Researchers have proposed various techniques to stabilize GAN training, such as using a gradient penalty, spectral normalization, or leaky integrals. These improvements help reduce mode collapse (the phenomenon where the generator focuses on generating only a few specific examples) and produce more diverse samples.</p> </li> <li> <p>Conditional GANs: By conditioning the generator on additional input information, conditional GANs can synthesize new data that adheres to specified constraints. This has been applied in various domains such as image-to-image translation, text-to-image generation, and style transfer tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Large-scale GANs: Researchers have developed techniques for training extremely large GAN models on massive datasets, allowing them to capture intricate details and generate high-quality samples. These efforts include BigGAN, StyleGAN, and SwA-GAN, which have all demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various domains such as facial synthesis and super-resolution.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</p> <p>VAEs are probabilistic models that combine the capabilities of autoencoders with the expressiveness of variational inference. They have two components: an encoder network that learns a latent representation of the input data, and a decoder network that synthesizes new samples from this representation. VAEs enable efficient data compression and denoising while also providing a tractable way to explore the underlying structure of complex probability distributions.</p> <p>Recent advances in VAEs include:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Improved latent space exploration: Researchers have explored ways to better navigate the latent space, such as using normalizing flows or adding auxiliary variables. This has enabled the generation of higher quality samples and improved the interpretability of the learned representation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Conditional VAEs: By conditioning the encoder and decoder networks on additional information, researchers can generate new data that adheres to specific constraints, such as text-to-image synthesis or domain adaptation tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Differential privacy in VAEs: Adding differential privacy mechanisms to VAEs enables them to learn from sensitive datasets while preserving users' privacy. This has applications in areas like healthcare and finance where data privacy is a significant concern.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Beyond GANs and VAEs</p> <p>While GANs and VAEs have revolutionized generative modeling, there are other exciting directions for research:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Flow-based models: These models directly parameterize the probability density function of the data, enabling efficient sampling and inference. Popular examples include Real-NVP and Glow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Autoregressive models: Models like PixelCNN, GPT, and Diffusion Models predict conditional distributions of each data point based on previously generated points. This enables improved sample quality at the cost of increased computational complexity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Energy-based models: These models represent probability density functions in terms of an energy function and have shown promising results for modeling complex distributions, such as in denoising tasks or image generation.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Generative models like GANs and VAEs have made significant strides in various domains, from computer vision to natural language processing.

Goleman identifies five key components of emotional intelligence that are vital  for successful leadership: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-awareness: Successful leaders know themselves well, including their strengths, weaknesses, values, and goals. They can identify the impact of their emotions on their thinking and behavior and are open to feedback from others.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-regulation: Leaders who can manage their emotional responses effectively are better at handling difficult  situations and making sound decisions under pressure. They remain calm during crises and practice active listening in group settings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Motivation: Highly effective leaders possess a strong internal motivation to achieve their goals and inspire  others to do the same. They have a clear vision for their team or organization and can articulate it persuasively,  which helps align the efforts of their followers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Empathy: A leader who can understand and share the feelings of others is better equipped to connect with their  team members on a deeper level. This fosters trust and loyalty within the team and allows for a more supportive work  environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Social skills: Successful leaders are adept at building relationships, resolving conflicts, and working  effectively in teams. They can communicate clearly and inspire others to collaborate towards shared goals.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By developing these qualities, leaders can foster positive work environments, enhance their decision-making abilities, and drive success within their organizations.</p>"},{"location":"reading/neurips23/","title":"Interesting Papers from NeurIPS","text":"<p>While many papers at the conference have already appeared in preprints months earlier, there are still a number of ideas that stand out as worthwhile, overlooked ideas from the past year.</p>"},{"location":"reading/neurips23/#fine-tuning-language-models-with-just-forward-passes","title":"Fine-Tuning Language Models with Just Forward Passes","text":""},{"location":"reading/neurips23/#abstract","title":"Abstract","text":"<p><code>Fine-tuning language models (LMs) has yielded success on diverse downstream tasks, but as LMs grow in size, backpropagation requires a prohibitively large amount of memory. Zeroth-order (ZO) methods can in principle estimate gradients using only two forward passes but are theorized to be catastrophically slow for optimizing large models. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient zerothorder optimizer (MeZO), adapting the classical ZO-SGD method to operate in-place, thereby fine-tuning LMs with the same memory footprint as inference. For example, with a single A100 80GB GPU, MeZO can train a 30-billion parameter model, whereas fine-tuning with backpropagation can train only a 2.7B LM with the same budget. We conduct comprehensive experiments across model types (masked and autoregressive LMs), model scales (up to 66B), and downstream tasks (classification, multiple-choice, and generation). Our results demonstrate that (1) MeZO significantly outperforms in-context learning and linear probing; (2) MeZO achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning with backpropagation across multiple tasks, with up to 12\u00d7 memory reduction and up to 2\u00d7 GPU-hour reduction in our implementation; (3) MeZO is compatible with both full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA and prefix tuning; (4) MeZO can effectively optimize non-differentiable objectives (e.g., maximizing accuracy or F1). We support our empirical findings with theoretical insights, highlighting how adequate pre-training and task prompts enable MeZO to fine-tune huge models, despite classical ZO analyses suggesting otherwis</code> https://openreview.net/forum?id=Vota6rFhBQ</p>"},{"location":"reading/neurips23/#additive-decoders-for-latent-variables-identification-and-cartesian-product-extrapolation","title":"Additive Decoders for Latent Variables Identification and Cartesian-Product Extrapolation","text":"<p>https://openreview.net/attachment?id=R6KJN1AUAR&amp;name=pdf</p>"},{"location":"reading/neurips23/#from-pixels-to-ui-actions-learning-to-follow-instructions-via-graphical-user-interfaces","title":"From Pixels to UI Actions: Learning to Follow Instructions via Graphical User Interfaces","text":""},{"location":"reading/neurips23/#abstract_1","title":"Abstract","text":"<p><code>Much of the previous work towards digital agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) has relied on text-based representations (derived from HTML or other structured data sources), which are not always readily available.

This paper focuses on creating agents that interact with the digital world using the same conceptual interface that humans commonly use \u2014 via pixel-based screenshots and a generic action space corresponding to keyboard and mouse actions. Building upon recent progress in pixel-based pretraining, we show, for the first time, that it is possible for such agents to outperform human crowdworkers on the MiniWob++ benchmark of GUI-based instruction following tasks.</code> (Recent work from DeepMind and Google) https://openreview.net/attachment?id=3PjCt4kmRx&amp;name=pdf</p>"}]}
